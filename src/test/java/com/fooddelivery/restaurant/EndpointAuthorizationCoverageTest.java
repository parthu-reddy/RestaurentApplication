 * Every HTTP endpoint in this module must carry an authorization rule, at class or method level.

 * <p>Closes gap G-6 of the 2026-08-22 core services review. At the time of that review 26 of 150
 * endpoints across the platform had no authorization of any kind -- including an unauthenticated
 * KYC-approval callback and an order-invoice endpoint that returned both delivery OTPs. Those were
 * fixed; nothing stopped the next endpoint from arriving bare. This does.
 *
 * <p>Needs no Spring context, no database and no broker: it is a reflective scan over the compiled
 * controllers, so it cannot be skipped by an infrastructure failure.
